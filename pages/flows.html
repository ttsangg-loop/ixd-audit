			<h1>Flows & Patterns</h1>
			<p>
				Flows and patterns follow actions and paths that users can take based on <a href="https://miro.com/app/board/o9J_ltCzWDk=/" target="_blank">this Miro Board</a>. As per Atomic Design, this would be analogous to Templates although this analysis does not necessarily study how elements are brought together to craft page layouts.

			<h3>Adding New Things</h3>
			<p>When you create a new element in the admin-side of things (e.g. not creating a new project but creating a new variable, a new user, etc...) you start by clicking "+ Add New ___" at the bottom. After filling out your fields, you are able to save (or cancel). A banner will appear as a confirmation of your successful creation of this item.</p>

			<h3>Deleting Things</h3>
			<p>When you choose to delete something (which will often be hidden in an overflow menu), you are prompted to confirm via modal. The button that indicates confirmation of this non-reversible state is red. Confirmation will often appear in the form of a banner although this behaviour is not consistent across the platform.</p>

			<h3>Error States</h3>
			<p>Loopio uses error states and messaging through modals, preventing actions, etc... to explain why certain actions cannot be done and/or to stop users from brute forcing something if they have not input all required information.</p>

Note that when the user begins to edit any field, all error messaging disappears (perhaps not the best due to lack of transparency on what actually changed).</p>
