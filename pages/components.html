			<h1>Components</h1>
			<p>
				Components are built up from Building Blocks. They are the organisms found in Atomic Design. Here, we evolve from interactions that focus on state changes, accessing information from overflow menus, etc. and instead,look at interface elements with multiple moving parts and behaviours involves.

			<h3>Entry Cards</h3>
			<p>Our projects and libraries are organized in cards with various bits of information available. These cards not only show as questions to be answered, but also as answered questions that are saved to the Library to be accessed at a later date.</p>

			<h3>Modals</h3>
			<p>We use modals for a variety of reasons: one being to confirm if an action should be done and another one being another screen to allow additional fields to be entered/actions to be done. A modal breaks up the flow on the page and pauses interactions on the main screen before the action has been confirmed or completed.</p>

			<h3>Tables</h3>
			<p>Tables are used to sort and list information, typically by some sort of chronological or alphabetical order. We employ tables primarily to show progress at a glance, or just to organize lists like users on the platform.</p>

				<p class="caption">We have hover-oriented pagination where you cannot see how to scroll to the next view of the table until you hover over the available numbers. The table on the home dashboard also lets you hover over elements (e.g. progress bars) to bring up a tooltip on progress. Lastly, you can sort by elements with a caret icon by the header, such as Due Date.</p>
